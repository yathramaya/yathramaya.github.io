      <description>Depending on what or who the source of information is, Kibber, an idyllic village that adorns the cold and silent Spiti Valley with its warm and bright coloured houses will rest in all sorts of record books. Needless to say, whether Kibber really hosted India&amp;rsquo;s highest post office or the rugged roadway that led us there should be considered for a motorcyclist bucketlist, it being the the highest motorable road, is all a matter of debate.</description>

      <description>Everything looks brown here, the roads, the walls, the houses and of course the surrounding mountains, that never fail to establish their mammoth presence, constantly. It soon became my favorite past time to see the miniature buses, trucks, motorbikes moving like tiny insects along the narrow lines drawn along these huge mountains, pitting bigger and bigger vehicles against these huge rocks and then ridiculing their minuscule presence. The mountains silently reminded me of the fragility of our existence, the unsaid whispers through which they conveyed how they had seen life come and go, in an instant, in their time-lines.</description>

      <description>We decided to visit the Kibber Gompa on a day when we heard there was an important event. Not knowing what it was about, we went along, with our camera ready. We were surprised to find almost the entire village there, young and the old, with more joining in. There was an air of festivity and cheer. Not knowing the language, we smiled at whoever our eyes met with.</description>

      <description>My back was unaccustomed to the heavy load. It was more than a year since I had been on any serious multi-day hike. And, even though we had hired a couple of porters and a guide to carry the camping equipment and the cooking essentials, even the personal items that I had signed up to haul was seeming heavier than I had imagined. The moment I got out of the jeep and started walking through the narrow lanes of the village Dhak, two thoughts were on my mind.</description>

      <title>Andaman Forest Walk</title>

      <description>Neil Island being one of the smaller ones of the Andaman archipelago is an inconspicuous dot in the vast blue waters of the mighty Indian Ocean. Here one gets the sensation of being &amp;lsquo;bound&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;limited&amp;rsquo; by the land area. Getting to experience both sunrise and sunset on the same day was something that I looked forward to on small islands and Neil had not disappointed me in that respect and more.</description>
