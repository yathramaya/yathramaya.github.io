      <description>How far would have to drive out to actually get somewhere? Strange were my thoughts as we stared out of the SUV into the emptiness all arouund. Did we really have to get anywhere at all? In a desert like Wadi Rum it took only an hour worth of driving to get to a point where one&amp;rsquo;s source and destination started to look the same and considering we did not have any specific goal it was only logical to rely on our host who was intently driving onwards on a trail that could not have been older than a week.</description>
