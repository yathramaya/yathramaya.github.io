      <title>Talkeetna : Alaskan Hinterland</title>

      <description>As I walked the barely asphalted road that lead us from the well wooded section that closely guarded our hideout into what was the active and colorful part of the town, I started realizing why I liked this place so much. It was so much unlike the rest of the United States. There was an authentic small-town feel to it. Not the sterile and templated small-town that one gets used to in the U.</description>

      <title>Walking the Wadi Rum, Jordan</title>

      <description>How far would have to drive out to actually get somewhere? Strange were my thoughts as we stared out of the SUV into the emptiness all arouund. Did we really have to get anywhere at all? In a desert like Wadi Rum it took only an hour worth of driving to get to a point where one&amp;rsquo;s source and destination started to look the same and considering we did not have any specific goal it was only logical to rely on our host who was intently driving onwards on a trail that could not have been older than a week.</description>

      <title>Turkish Bath at a Hamam, Istanbul</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/hamam-at-istanbul-turkey.html</link>

      <description>After having spent two months backpacking and camping, the idea of a nice hot turkish bath seemed most desirable. Although I did not have a first hand experience about a Hamam, having read a few blogs about it, I felt I was bold enough to give it a try. Having been to Istanbul and not trying the Hamam was not acceptable for me. I kept putting it off for the first couple of days, with certain inhibitions taking hold of my cravings of a hot bath.</description>

      <title>Staying in a Cavehouse at Goreme, Cappadocia</title>

      <description>Goreme was a beautiful town in a valley beyond the vast, brown mountains and the endless mounds of what looked like mud. That morning, we were transferred to a mini-bus after an overnight journey in a comfortable, large bus. We had got used to the efficiency of this country, and the general goodness of people, so we only had to step out of the bus and step into the smaller bus, without having to fuss about our luggages, which were perfectly tagged and transferred promptly.</description>

      <title>Azaan at Sultanahmet, Istanbul</title>

      <description>Walking the crowded streets of Sultanahmet late evening, I was trying to negotiate a road crossing, just as a tram passed the street. The wind was chill yet filled with the aroma of the food from the roadside restaurants. Just then, I heard the most melodious tune somewhere far, that made me freeze. I just stood there mesmerized, holding on to every single sound that came out from this singer. The words &amp;ldquo;Allahu Akhbar&amp;rdquo;, probably heard several times in my lifetime, had never before sounded so beautiful, so profound.</description>

      <description>Local train journey in Sri Lanka is a must do to see the culture up close. And, what&amp;rsquo;s better than the coastal rail route that offers some breathtaking views of the coast as well. Our started at this quaint little station called Bentota.</description>

      <title>A walk through Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Srilanka</title>

      <description>I had imagined this drop-shaped island country always to have been green; a green dot floating in the endless blue waters of the mighty Indian Ocean. I would like to believe that it was once covered with dense, impenetrable tropical rainforests, with inneumerable waterfalls, countless streams flowing through. It was as though in an effort to recreate this lost experience, this missed opportunity, that I chose to trek through the Sinharaja Forest Reserve as one of my first experiences in Sri Lanka.</description>

      <title>Glacier Tour, Seward, Alaska</title>

      <description>A bald eagle swooped in very close to our boat as we set off. The sun was struggling to shine through the dense grey clouds that threatened to pour down anytime. To be sailing off into the icy cold waters of the Pacific, with limited visibility, in the hope of seeing some glaciers, started to seem a bit ambitious. The misty cold morning confined most of us to the cozy interior of the boat, with little to look forward to other than this bald eagle and a friendly otter that did not seem to mind either our boat or the ice cold water.</description>

      <title>Wildlife Viewing in Denali National Park</title>

      <description>We got onto the transit bus to Wonder Lake, one of the farthest campgrounds inside the Denali National park. Springtime being good tourist season, the bus was full and we managed to occupy the last second row. With my camera ready, I glued my eyes to the window of the bus, carefully scanning the vast landscape for any movement</description>

      <title>Staying in a remote East Ugandan Village, Africa</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Is it true that women will be burnt alive for dowry in India?&amp;rdquo; Mai asked with her fear in her eyes and her palm covering her mouth. She did not mean to offend me. The innocence in her voice and her genuine concern for her sisters in India made me offer a simple, plain answer. &amp;ldquo;Yes, it does happen even now in some villages, although it is not legal&amp;rdquo; I tried to calm her down.</description>

      <title>Whale Watching at Mirissa, Sri Lanka</title>

      <description>This was nothing close to what I had ever imagined. The boat was rather small. The waves were menacingly rough, challenging to throw the boat off balance at the slightest opportunity. There were about 20 people on the boat, most of them in various stages of sea sickness. The lucky ones, like myself, who were miraculously unaffected by the rough sea, were on the deck with our eyes glued to the waters.</description>

      <title>Live Music Bar at Goreme, Cappadocia, Turkey</title>

      <description>The cold air was broken by the white trail of warm breath as I walked in the night. The bar was just a block away from where we stayed. The tables were only beginning to get filled up, when I realized that more people were coming in around the same time. We took a table for two, ordered some Raki, that came with some soft bread and dips. The lights were dim and created a warm, cozy atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Camping next to Savage river, Denali National Park</title>

      <description>The weather was perfect when we entered Denali. The sun was bright and our bus made a special stop on the way to see the majestic mountain because it is not everyday that she presents herself in such glorious view. After completing the mandatory registration and collecting the campsite markers, I got on the park bus that would take me to the campsite, Savage River. It was the farthest point in the park route that allows private vehicles, although we were not driving, so took the bus.</description>

      <title>Denali at her raw best</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/denali-at-her-raw-best.html</link>

      <guid>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/denali-at-her-raw-best.html</guid>
      <description>Sitting in the park bus, we felt as though we were on a private tour of Denali, just 4 of us, and our guide cum driver, Nick. By afternoon the entire Denali range was covered by thick clouds, it had started to get dark, our chances of spotting wildlife also diminished with the daylight. With the rain looming on the horizon, we almost had the entire park for ourselves. Driving through thick fog, with our headlights on, with almost no visibility, the raw beauty of Denali, the vast river plains, the mountains showed us yet another side, which was entirely different from what we had seen the previous day.</description>

      <title>My adventures with Matatus</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/adventures-with-matatus.html</link>

      <description>Before travelling to East Africa, I had managed my travels with two grand assumptions (a) long distances are better covered by night (b) if you are ready to pay a price, there are better options in public transport. While these two were busted pretty quickly, none of my experiences so far had prepared me for a “matatu”.
From whatever I had read earlier, before landing in Kenya, I had deduced that all my travels had to be done during the day.</description>

      <title>Stuck in Serengeti</title>

      <description>At this point, I knew we were not getting anywhere. We were in the middle of wilderness with a vehicle that refused to move and nobody in sight for miles to even ask for assistance. As the driver got out of the vehicle to collect more logs, I was thinking about the lions we just saw and how they might have sensed that a human being was walking around. They could be watching us from a distance and tracking our movements.</description>

      <title>An unforgettable encounter with our closest cousin</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/our-closest-cousin.html</link>

      <guid>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/our-closest-cousin.html</guid>
      <description>It is unmistakably the most beautiful place we would be staying in our entire trip. I could spend hours just looking at these mountains, the rainforests and never cease to be amazed by their existence, being drawn into them further and further with every passing moment. I could be lost momentarily in mundane tasks like eating or washing clothes or fussing about the ants; but the presence of the mountains constantly pulls me into a trance every now and then.</description>

      <title>A walk through Stone Town, Zanzibar</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/stonetown-zanzibar.html</link>

      <guid>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/stonetown-zanzibar.html</guid>
      <description>Just outside, you find yourself in a typical African town, with people getting about their routine work. There is traffic, pollution, vehicles honking, hawkers selling everything from bread, fruits, vegetables, newspaper to bags, shoes, clothes and people haggling for a good bargain; burqa clad school girls gossiping in small groups, giggling, waiting for their bus; high school boys trying to look like grown up men, wearing their traditional cap and gown, but their their school bags giving them away.</description>
