      <description>At this point, I knew we were not getting anywhere. We were in the middle of wilderness with a vehicle that refused to move and nobody in sight for miles to even ask for assistance. As the driver got out of the vehicle to collect more logs, I was thinking about the lions we just saw and how they might have sensed that a human being was walking around. They could be watching us from a distance and tracking our movements.</description>

      <description>Just outside, you find yourself in a typical African town, with people getting about their routine work. There is traffic, pollution, vehicles honking, hawkers selling everything from bread, fruits, vegetables, newspaper to bags, shoes, clothes and people haggling for a good bargain; burqa clad school girls gossiping in small groups, giggling, waiting for their bus; high school boys trying to look like grown up men, wearing their traditional cap and gown, but their their school bags giving them away.</description>
