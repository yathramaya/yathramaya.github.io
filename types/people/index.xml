      <title>Staying in a Cavehouse at Goreme, Cappadocia</title>

      <description>Goreme was a beautiful town in a valley beyond the vast, brown mountains and the endless mounds of what looked like mud. That morning, we were transferred to a mini-bus after an overnight journey in a comfortable, large bus. We had got used to the efficiency of this country, and the general goodness of people, so we only had to step out of the bus and step into the smaller bus, without having to fuss about our luggages, which were perfectly tagged and transferred promptly.</description>

      <title>Azaan at Sultanahmet, Istanbul</title>

      <description>Walking the crowded streets of Sultanahmet late evening, I was trying to negotiate a road crossing, just as a tram passed the street. The wind was chill yet filled with the aroma of the food from the roadside restaurants. Just then, I heard the most melodious tune somewhere far, that made me freeze. I just stood there mesmerized, holding on to every single sound that came out from this singer. The words &amp;ldquo;Allahu Akhbar&amp;rdquo;, probably heard several times in my lifetime, had never before sounded so beautiful, so profound.</description>

      <title>A Himalayan Hamlet : Kibber, Spiti Valley</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/kibber-a-himalayan-hamlet.html</link>

      <description>Depending on what or who the source of information is, Kibber, an idyllic village that adorns the cold and silent Spiti Valley with its warm and bright coloured houses will rest in all sorts of record books. Needless to say, whether Kibber really hosted India&amp;rsquo;s highest post office or the rugged roadway that led us there should be considered for a motorcyclist bucketlist, it being the the highest motorable road, is all a matter of debate.</description>

      <title>When the entire village came dressed in their finery</title>

      <description>We decided to visit the Kibber Gompa on a day when we heard there was an important event. Not knowing what it was about, we went along, with our camera ready. We were surprised to find almost the entire village there, young and the old, with more joining in. There was an air of festivity and cheer. Not knowing the language, we smiled at whoever our eyes met with.</description>

      <title>Staying in a remote East Ugandan Village, Africa</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Is it true that women will be burnt alive for dowry in India?&amp;rdquo; Mai asked with her fear in her eyes and her palm covering her mouth. She did not mean to offend me. The innocence in her voice and her genuine concern for her sisters in India made me offer a simple, plain answer. &amp;ldquo;Yes, it does happen even now in some villages, although it is not legal&amp;rdquo; I tried to calm her down.</description>

      <title>Live Music Bar at Goreme, Cappadocia, Turkey</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/live-music-bar-goreme.html</link>

      <description>The cold air was broken by the white trail of warm breath as I walked in the night. The bar was just a block away from where we stayed. The tables were only beginning to get filled up, when I realized that more people were coming in around the same time. We took a table for two, ordered some Raki, that came with some soft bread and dips. The lights were dim and created a warm, cozy atmosphere.</description>

      <title>My adventures with Matatus</title>

      <description>Before travelling to East Africa, I had managed my travels with two grand assumptions (a) long distances are better covered by night (b) if you are ready to pay a price, there are better options in public transport. While these two were busted pretty quickly, none of my experiences so far had prepared me for a “matatu”.
From whatever I had read earlier, before landing in Kenya, I had deduced that all my travels had to be done during the day.</description>

      <title>A walk through Stone Town, Zanzibar</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/stonetown-zanzibar.html</link>

      <description>Just outside, you find yourself in a typical African town, with people getting about their routine work. There is traffic, pollution, vehicles honking, hawkers selling everything from bread, fruits, vegetables, newspaper to bags, shoes, clothes and people haggling for a good bargain; burqa clad school girls gossiping in small groups, giggling, waiting for their bus; high school boys trying to look like grown up men, wearing their traditional cap and gown, but their their school bags giving them away.</description>
