      <description>As I walked the barely asphalted road that lead us from the well wooded section that closely guarded our hideout into what was the active and colorful part of the town, I started realizing why I liked this place so much. It was so much unlike the rest of the United States. There was an authentic small-town feel to it. Not the sterile and templated small-town that one gets used to in the U.</description>

      <description>The weather was perfect when we entered Denali. The sun was bright and our bus made a special stop on the way to see the majestic mountain because it is not everyday that she presents herself in such glorious view. After completing the mandatory registration and collecting the campsite markers, I got on the park bus that would take me to the campsite, Savage River. It was the farthest point in the park route that allows private vehicles, although we were not driving, so took the bus.</description>
