      <description>As I walked the barely asphalted road that lead us from the well wooded section that closely guarded our hideout into what was the active and colorful part of the town, I started realizing why I liked this place so much. It was so much unlike the rest of the United States. There was an authentic small-town feel to it. Not the sterile and templated small-town that one gets used to in the U.</description>

      <description>A bald eagle swooped in very close to our boat as we set off. The sun was struggling to shine through the dense grey clouds that threatened to pour down anytime. To be sailing off into the icy cold waters of the Pacific, with limited visibility, in the hope of seeing some glaciers, started to seem a bit ambitious. The misty cold morning confined most of us to the cozy interior of the boat, with little to look forward to other than this bald eagle and a friendly otter that did not seem to mind either our boat or the ice cold water.</description>

      <description>We got onto the transit bus to Wonder Lake, one of the farthest campgrounds inside the Denali National park. Springtime being good tourist season, the bus was full and we managed to occupy the last second row. With my camera ready, I glued my eyes to the window of the bus, carefully scanning the vast landscape for any movement</description>

      <title>Camping next to Savage river, Denali National Park</title>

      <description>The weather was perfect when we entered Denali. The sun was bright and our bus made a special stop on the way to see the majestic mountain because it is not everyday that she presents herself in such glorious view. After completing the mandatory registration and collecting the campsite markers, I got on the park bus that would take me to the campsite, Savage River. It was the farthest point in the park route that allows private vehicles, although we were not driving, so took the bus.</description>

      <title>Denali at her raw best</title>

      <description>Sitting in the park bus, we felt as though we were on a private tour of Denali, just 4 of us, and our guide cum driver, Nick. By afternoon the entire Denali range was covered by thick clouds, it had started to get dark, our chances of spotting wildlife also diminished with the daylight. With the rain looming on the horizon, we almost had the entire park for ourselves. Driving through thick fog, with our headlights on, with almost no visibility, the raw beauty of Denali, the vast river plains, the mountains showed us yet another side, which was entirely different from what we had seen the previous day.</description>
