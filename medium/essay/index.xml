      <title>Talkeetna : Alaskan Hinterland</title>

      <description>As I walked the barely asphalted road that lead us from the well wooded section that closely guarded our hideout into what was the active and colorful part of the town, I started realizing why I liked this place so much. It was so much unlike the rest of the United States. There was an authentic small-town feel to it. Not the sterile and templated small-town that one gets used to in the U.</description>

      <title>Walking the Wadi Rum, Jordan</title>

      <description>How far would have to drive out to actually get somewhere? Strange were my thoughts as we stared out of the SUV into the emptiness all arouund. Did we really have to get anywhere at all? In a desert like Wadi Rum it took only an hour worth of driving to get to a point where one&amp;rsquo;s source and destination started to look the same and considering we did not have any specific goal it was only logical to rely on our host who was intently driving onwards on a trail that could not have been older than a week.</description>

      <title>Turkish Bath at a Hamam, Istanbul</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/hamam-at-istanbul-turkey.html</link>

      <description>After having spent two months backpacking and camping, the idea of a nice hot turkish bath seemed most desirable. Although I did not have a first hand experience about a Hamam, having read a few blogs about it, I felt I was bold enough to give it a try. Having been to Istanbul and not trying the Hamam was not acceptable for me. I kept putting it off for the first couple of days, with certain inhibitions taking hold of my cravings of a hot bath.</description>

      <title>Staying in a Cavehouse at Goreme, Cappadocia</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/goreme-cappadocia-homestay.html</link>

      <description>Goreme was a beautiful town in a valley beyond the vast, brown mountains and the endless mounds of what looked like mud. That morning, we were transferred to a mini-bus after an overnight journey in a comfortable, large bus. We had got used to the efficiency of this country, and the general goodness of people, so we only had to step out of the bus and step into the smaller bus, without having to fuss about our luggages, which were perfectly tagged and transferred promptly.</description>

      <title>Azaan at Sultanahmet, Istanbul</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/azaan-at-sultanahmet-istanbul.html</link>

      <description>Walking the crowded streets of Sultanahmet late evening, I was trying to negotiate a road crossing, just as a tram passed the street. The wind was chill yet filled with the aroma of the food from the roadside restaurants. Just then, I heard the most melodious tune somewhere far, that made me freeze. I just stood there mesmerized, holding on to every single sound that came out from this singer. The words &amp;ldquo;Allahu Akhbar&amp;rdquo;, probably heard several times in my lifetime, had never before sounded so beautiful, so profound.</description>

      <title>A Himalayan Hamlet : Kibber, Spiti Valley</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/kibber-a-himalayan-hamlet.html</link>

      <description>Depending on what or who the source of information is, Kibber, an idyllic village that adorns the cold and silent Spiti Valley with its warm and bright coloured houses will rest in all sorts of record books. Needless to say, whether Kibber really hosted India&amp;rsquo;s highest post office or the rugged roadway that led us there should be considered for a motorcyclist bucketlist, it being the the highest motorable road, is all a matter of debate.</description>

      <title>My adventures with Matatus</title>

      <description>Before travelling to East Africa, I had managed my travels with two grand assumptions (a) long distances are better covered by night (b) if you are ready to pay a price, there are better options in public transport. While these two were busted pretty quickly, none of my experiences so far had prepared me for a “matatu”.
From whatever I had read earlier, before landing in Kenya, I had deduced that all my travels had to be done during the day.</description>

      <title>A walk through Stone Town, Zanzibar</title>
      <link>https://yatramaya.hoatz.in/experiences/stonetown-zanzibar.html</link>

      <description>Just outside, you find yourself in a typical African town, with people getting about their routine work. There is traffic, pollution, vehicles honking, hawkers selling everything from bread, fruits, vegetables, newspaper to bags, shoes, clothes and people haggling for a good bargain; burqa clad school girls gossiping in small groups, giggling, waiting for their bus; high school boys trying to look like grown up men, wearing their traditional cap and gown, but their their school bags giving them away.</description>

      <title>Andaman Forest Walk</title>

      <description>Neil Island being one of the smaller ones of the Andaman archipelago is an inconspicuous dot in the vast blue waters of the mighty Indian Ocean. Here one gets the sensation of being &amp;lsquo;bound&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;limited&amp;rsquo; by the land area. Getting to experience both sunrise and sunset on the same day was something that I looked forward to on small islands and Neil had not disappointed me in that respect and more.</description>
