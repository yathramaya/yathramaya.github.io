					<p>I had imagined this drop-shaped island country always to have been green;
a green dot floating in the endless blue waters of the mighty Indian Ocean.
I would like to believe that it was once covered with dense, impenetrable
tropical rainforests, with inneumerable waterfalls, countless streams
flowing through. It was as though in an effort to recreate this lost
experience, this missed opportunity, that I chose to trek through the
Sinharaja Forest Reserve as one of my first experiences in Sri Lanka.
It was probably my attempt in holding on to the last remaining patch of
pristine primary forests that have fast disappeared everywhere else
in the South. This dangerous, dark and mysterious forest has been
a legends for centuries, once believed to have been home to the &ldquo;Sinha&rdquo;,
the lion, although I was not convinced about that completely. I had to
be careful while treading this ancient land and witness history, lest I
cause any harm unknowingly to the precious vegetation and its delicate
ecosystem. It was with this in mind that I had chosen our guide, Pali,
who was well-respected as a local guide and naturalist.</p>
<p>When I finally met him, after my long, overnight journey by flight and
then car from India, all the way down South, I was reassured by his
warm smile and friendly welcome to his homestay. With over 30 years of
knowing these forests intimately, his child-like enthusiasm when he
spoke of his time in the forests was heartening. I felt that the forest
was his home, and he was proud to share it with us for a brief period.</p>
<p>We set off the next morning in a jeep to the entrance of the Sinharaja
Forest Reserve, now a UNESCO world heritage site. The mist-covered path
was through some settlements and cultivation. As we drove,
I could see how the forest has been encroached, inch by inch, each year,
with extensive human activity so close by. Located in the South west
lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka, these rainforests have been a lifeline
to the surrounding villages, in terms of water supply and forest
produce. Once spread far and wide, the rainforests are now squeezed
into a 7km by 21 km area and is constantly under threat by loggers
and poachers, although protected on paper. I could understand the
vulnerability of this precious forest as Pali explained about the
threats and pressures these trees face each day. We had reached early
and the guard post at the entrace was still unoccupied.</p>

<p>Loading salt into our socks, which was Pali&rsquo;s trusted method of keeping
away leeches, which were plenty here, we set off on the trail. The
path went through some really large trees right from the entrance. Just
a few minutes into our walk, I noticed the darkness. The tall trees with
their canopies had almost completely cut off sunlight. And I could hear the
unmistakable forest sounds surrounded us as we walked. Known as the most dense
rainforests in the whole of Asia, the amount of life found was astounding.
Every tree had intertwined vines, creepers, epiphytes, moss growing on
them, there was barely any separation, with dense undergrowth, I could
feel the presence of frogs, insects and probably snakes at every step.
More than 60% of the species of amphibians, reptiles, birds and insects
found here are endemic. The darkness and density of the forest makes
it very difficult to spot wildlife, although I could hear numerous
bird calls. Pali tried to show us some of the endemic species, we came
across a tree frog on one of the fallen trees. This massive tree that
was lying in our path, was supporting so much life even after its death.</p>

<p>We stopped at a specific point, where he felt something move under
the leaves. The forest floor was covered with fallen leaves and he suspected
it could be a pit viper, although I could not get a chance to see
it clearly. The tall trees supported amazing amount of bird life and
it was almost impossible to spot them in the darkness. It had started to
rain a little and we continued our walk under the dense canopy. The forests
are covered by mist and fog for most part of the year, with a wet
climate almost year round. Just outside the forests, it could have been
bright and sunny; the microclimate created by these trees was truly
remarkable. The path slowly ascends and takes us to even denser parts
of the rainforest. It was impossible to tread this path without a guide;
the probability of getting lost was so high. Pali was careful to make
sure that we walked only on the trail, to ensure that the vegetation is
not disturbed. I could see that he cared for every tree, every little creature
and treated them with love and respect. I felt he was like this child who
was eager to show his priced possessions, yet cautious enough to not give
it completely in your hand, in the fear of damaging it.</p>
<p>We heard some loud sound echo across the forest, it were monkeys. I got
excited when Pali mentioned that it was the purple faced monkey, which is
endemic to this forest. Through my binoculars, with much effort, I could
spot this dark coloured monkey and her young one clinging to it. Her face
was dark, a little purple probably, giving it the name. She was high in the
canopy with very little light around, spoiling my efforts at getting a good
picture. I was satisfied watching her through my binoculars. Having walked
for almost an hour and a half, it was time for a break.</p>

<p>We climbed a little to reach some rocks and I could hear the sound of flowing
water. Just then, Pali asked if we were ready for a swim. Before I could answer,
he was walked quickly towards the rocks and in this clearing, there was a
beautiful waterfall at some distance, with some smaller water falls along the
stream. The water was cool and clear. I sat there on the rocks with my tired
feet in the cool waters and enjoying getting nibbled by the numerous fish
that were eagerly looking forward for a snack. Pali swam in the waters and
came back refreshed. There was noone around except for our small group. We
found this sun kissed spot a nice place for our lunch, which was packed for
all of us in the morning. Sitting there in this piece of heaven on earth,
I felt lucky to have been part of this precious piece of history that is
believed to go all the way back to the days of Gondwananland.</p>
