					<p>Neil Island being one of the smaller ones of the Andaman archipelago is
an inconspicuous dot in the vast blue waters of the mighty Indian Ocean.
Here one gets the sensation of being &lsquo;bound&rsquo; or &lsquo;limited&rsquo; by the land
area. Getting to experience both sunrise and sunset on the same day was
something that I looked forward to on small islands and Neil had not
disappointed me in that respect and more. In just a couple of days of
arriving on Neil Island, I got the feeling that I had explored
everything there was worth exploring. So when my local host offered to
take me to a &lsquo;secret&rsquo; beach the next morning, I could not contain my
excitement and curiosity. A &lsquo;secret&rsquo; beach! Where could that possibly be?</p>

<p>We set off at dawn after a breakfast that I insisted on being mostly
consisting of fruit because I expected a long walk. I was accompanied
by Shrivas and his three enthusiastic boys. Initially it was an unmarked
trail that took us through neighboring coconut farms where at one point
a tender coconut break was declared. While the cocunut trees were only
two person tall, I still wondered about what implements would be needed
for us to reach towards the refreshing fruit. That is when one of the
boys, with the dexterity of a trained climber climbed onto one of the
trees and started dropping coconuts. This was also when Shrivas revealed
his preparedness when he removed a machete from the little bag he
was carrying and just like that, we were all sipping the sweetest
and coolest tender coconut water; energy that should help us second leg
of the journey.</p>
<p>I noticed the foliage on the forest floor around the same time that I
noticed the lack of the harsh sun burning a hole into my neck. Our walk had
progressed from the cultivated sections to the well wooded areas with
trees so tall that I couldn&rsquo;t estimate the height of their canopies.
My host was animatedly gesturing at the size of some of the trees and
I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. They were mammoth in size. They were estimated to
be over 500 years old, he told me and I noticed that age and wisdom
does reveal itself on their barks. They had fissures so deep and wide
that stems of other medium trees could be easily tucked into them.</p>

<p>I moved forward with carefully placed, measured steps as the forest floor
seemed full of life. But even then my nimble footed attempts would break
a twig here or crush a leaf there and I would look up and check if I had
in any way distrubed the great-grandfather trees that were having an
afternoon nap. In fact if it wasn&rsquo;t for knowing the actual time, the
lack of penetrating sunlight would have fooled me into thinking that it
was late evening.</p>
<p>It was not dark everywhere though. Once in a while we came across
openings that were created by the fall of large trees where the younger
ones in the area seemed to have started competing for growth; a process
that should take them many more years if they are spared the axe by
us. The fallen trees completely cut off the trail in some places and
we had to take detours. Sometimes we could climb over the rotting trunks
that were now homes to various insects and reptiles that were seeking
them for a meal. At this point it seemed that we were the only source
of sound in the forest. While the boys walked ahead with the inherent
curiosity of childhood, me and Shrivas followed behind.</p>

<p>Shrivas spoke to me continously about a lot of things but distracted
as I was in a silent communion with the trees, I registered only parts
of it. He spoke of the times his father migrated to the Andamans
during the conflict in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) and the ensuing
refugee crisis. About how these islands had a larger number of trees
and undoubtedly a large number of animals, including mammals. Sadly,
only nominal portions of that past glory now remains.</p>
<p>Somewhere up in the canopy I heard muffled sounds. It must have been
birds although I did not hear any calling. I craned my neck and made
a futile attempt to look through the dense foliage well knowing that
it was an impossibility to spot anything. And perhaps to shed myself
of the tragic knowledge of the history and destiny of these beautiful
forests at our hands, I imagined that the long vines would come to life
and like tentacles pick us up and throw us out of their territory. I
am unsure if it was my anticipation but the fresh aroma of the earth
underneath the forest had a tinge of saltiness to it.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking, almost wishing that the sea must be close by
despite there being no sounds of waves. I eagerly awaited for a dramatic
event of the forest thinning out to reveal the blues and the whites
of sandy beaches but instead the forest thickened and we seemed to be
going deeper. Shrivas however, assured me that the walk was short and
we would be soaking up the afternoon sun in no time. To make most out
of the time in the forest, I stopped and took photographs of the
creatures I met. Crabs, Spiders and Insects of various shapes and colors
had made homes everywhere under our feet.</p>
<p>Larger animals such as the Wild Boar and Deer now existed only in the
stories that Shrivas was telling me as I stopped and sat down low to
take photographs of trail of ants that were on their own version
of a mid-day trek, unminding our giant legs, marching along fallen
twigs, stones and precariously perched dry leaves. The sudden darkening
of the surroundings was a cue for me to continue on the walk.</p>

<p>Just when I had let myself be focussed on the goals ahead and started
to walk briskly, a movement on the forest floor forced me to pause
again. It was a large crab. It was larger than any I had ever seen
before. But despite my best intentions and stealth, it ran away into
the nearest hole in the ground before I could get my camera out. But all
was not lost. A chameleon which sat at a vantage point and was observing
my madness was willing to pose for my photograph like a model would.</p>
<p>My host was amused that I was even spotting these creatures. In fact he
proudly declared that his skills at spotting was exclusively used when
he needed to eat them. Then he went ahead joked and congratulated me for
having the skills for survival. While we shared that laugh, his sons
who found my interest rather amusing volunteered to be additional eyes
for me and then went on a mission to show me creepy crawlies. This
made the rest of the walk even more enjoyable.</p>

<p>When we finally reached the sea, the drama that I wished for wasn&rsquo;t
visual, it was very physical instead. Instead of being seductively
visible minutes before the forest ended, it was as if a wooden curtain
had been pulled up in front of the beach. We cut through the foliage
and vines and then stepped over knotty exposed roots to find ourselves
out in the open, on a sandy beach with clear blue water and blue skies
for the backdrop. It had taken about 45 minutes I realized only to
wonder why it felt like we walked for ages.</p>
<p>When I looked to the left it was the beach for a few hundred meters and
and then the land curved behind us. To the right I could see that the
beach ended abruptly after which the land met the sea at a series of
large rocks. All along the shore smaller trees and mangroves lined
up like a margin between the sand and the old forest.</p>

<p>While we walked towards the right end of the beach, unable to sustain
the patience that adults seem to have, the boys ran into the water. I
climbed one of the rocks that was mostly in the shallow water but
provided a nice ramp to climb from all the way from the sand. It was
beautiful from the top, the endless ocean meeting a white sandy beach
and then the lush green of the forest. To know that such a space existed
within the touristy Neil Island was new knowledge to me. I do not know
how much of a &lsquo;secret&rsquo; and even if so, how long it would remain one.</p>
<p>The boys who weren&rsquo;t here for the views had already got onto the
business of using the rock as a diving platform and were one by one
lauching themselves into the cool waters below. One of them had also
found a makeshift raft the discovery of which resulted in games of
overcrowding and overturning. Shrivas meanwhile was calling me down

<p>Shrivas proposed that we explore a cave to our right, just after the
beach had ended and under the high rocks that formed the further
shoreline. To reach there, we would have to first enter the water and
then wade towards the right. This at first seemed easy considering
the water was shallow near the shore at most reaching chest levels. The
problem was the strong waves that terminated with a bang against the
rocks.</p>
<p>As soon as we started on this mission, I could see why Shrivas had
gently broached the topic. The force was unlike what I imagined. The
constant waves threatened to knock me off my feet and paste me onto
the sharp rocks on my right. It was advised that I move slowly in
between other smaller rocks to lessen the impact of the waves. The fact
that I had to step on sharp rocks that cut the underside of my feet
made this harder than it was supposed to be. I somehow made it back
in one piece after taking a u-turn at the cave which was anyway not
accessible for any kind of detailed inspection.</p>

<p>I was relieved to be back on the shore after the little adventure that
left me drained. After some rest, I decided instead to join the kids at
the diving platform into the sea. Ensuring that there was enough
depth for a dive, I took to the platform for the first dive. Seeing that
a long standing invitation was taken, the boys cheered me on and I got
a cooler and calmer version of the sea. A few more rounds of this
activity and some swimming later, we took a break for a snack.</p>
<p>When Shrivas went and slept under the shade of a tree I got the message
that it was time for an afternoon siesta. Taking the cue, I proceeded
for the same. The children had by now with renewed energy taken to the
makeshift raft again and were frolicking in the water. As I closed my
eyes, I thought about my good fortune to have visited this quiet corner
of Neil Island and experiencing the solitude. A gentle breeze caressed
me as I dozed off.</p>
