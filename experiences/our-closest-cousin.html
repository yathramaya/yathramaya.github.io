					<p>It is unmistakably the most beautiful place we would be staying in our entire trip. I could spend hours just looking at these mountains, the rainforests and never cease to be amazed by their existence, being drawn into them further and further with every passing moment. I could be lost momentarily in mundane tasks like eating or washing clothes or fussing about the ants; but the presence of the mountains constantly pulls me into a trance every now and then. And I just sit and stare at them, for several minutes at a stretch. The tall, slender trees with their canopies extending towards the sky, the green and the brown colours that become distinct as the sun shines at them, briefly, between the spells of heavy rain. It is not for no reason that they are called rain forests. When it does rain, it pours and completely covers my view of the trees, by mist. The more I gaze at them, I keep discovering more layers, ranges that extend as far as my eyes can see, always covered in mist. The clouds move amongst the ranges, white fluffy tufts floating around. There is always a feeling that it is about to rain any moment.</p>
<p>These mysterious mountains are the last refuge to the very few remaining mountain gorillas in the world. The gorillas that have adapted to survive in these rain forests, have failed to survive anywhere else in the world, making this piece of forest the most precious habitat. Each time I look at these misty mountains, I can only pray that they remain as they are, impenetrable to humans.</p>

<p>The first thing that drew me to these mountains was when I heard about their name “Bwindi Impenetrable Forests”. Impenetrable — the word itself is enchanting, formidable, at the same time seducing. I thought, what would it take to “penetrate” them? How would it feel? Would the forest allow me to pass through? to share a few minutes amongst the mammoth trees and the majestic inhabitants? This was sufficient for planning a trip there, although knowing very well that it would be a long, arduous, stressful journey to reach this remote corner of western Uganda. It is so remote that there is no public transport to this place (we had to hire a private cab). Not just that. These forests border DRC — Democratic Republic of Congo, which is the heart of African continent, which is the greenest part of the globe when seen on the satellite map, the whole country seemingly covered by rain forests, hosting innumerable species of plant and animal life. A country, that we knew, we could never go to, sadly. Not because of the forests, but because of the human conflict, stories of violence, kidnapping, complete breakdown of civic facilities, law and order, making it dangerous for travellers (and for locals also).</p>
<p>The fact that the Congo is completely out of bounds for us was another huge factor that added to the mystique of visiting Bwindi. While driving towards Buhoma (one of the villages close to south of Bwindi forests), we chanced upon a road that would lead to the border of DRC, just 10 kms away. This got my heart racing. What if I just sneaked into the country and got lost in the forests? For the animals, the country borders are non existent. They cross over freely, as long as their food is available. It is probably not a coincidence that a country rife with political upheavals, completely closed to tourists (as well as some of the bravest explorers), is one of the richest in natural resources — trees as well as animal species.</p>

<p>We were lucky to be staying in a campsite that is just walking distance from the forests. The camp is run by CTPH — Conservation Through Public Health, a gorilla conservation centre focused on improving the awareness and overall health of surrounding villages. And rehabilitating the villagers by encouraging them to grow coffee. They routinely collect gorilla faeces samples from the forests and examine them for deadly diseases. The have basic camping and room facilities for stay and a kitchen. They also arrange gorilla passes to trek into the forest. They have a friendly team of doctors, staff and volunteers to take you around and explain the significance of their work here.</p>
<p>We are sitting at this edge of the forests, at the foothills of these mountains, living in their presence. The constant sound of various birds in our camp is the only sound that breaks the silence. The view from the campsite as we just sit casually and sip coffee is out of the world. We were here for three days, but every moment felt exciting like something is about to happen. It was like this mega screen of life unfolding in front of me, leaving us guessing what mysteries are hidden behind their “impenetrable” canopies. The scenery changed every now and then. The cool mountain breeze grazing our extremities and leaving us feel refreshed. The passing clouds, ever changing in sizes and shapes, were covering and unfolding different views. Sometimes I felt like they were right in front of me and I could just walk right into them. The fact that the campsite itself was on top of a hill gave the feeling that the clouds are just passing in front of us and not above us.</p>

<p>We walked through the tea plantations surrounding the forests, at the edges. Though it felt strange to be knowing something as commercial as tea was existing just outside one of the richest rainforests, we later came to know that it was strategic move by the forest authority. They serve the purpose of forming a buffer zone for avoiding the human-gorilla conflict as the gorillas do not feed on tea leaves, they do not tend to cross over to the human settlements. We were ascending the mountain along the slope covered by tea plantations. I was breathing heaving and gasping soon due the the chill mountain air. I wanted to ascend slowly but I was impatient to cross over the tea gardens quickly into the forests.</p>
<p>The change was dramatic. The boundary was a thin line, at one moment we were in open plantations, the next moment we were into the forest. The dense canopy, the dampness of the air, the rich, rotting mulch under my feet indicated our entry into the forest. We were no longer just wandering in tea plantations. We had entered the rainforest. The path was difficult and treacherous. We walked in slush, with our shoes completely wet within minutes of entering the forest. We crossed numerous streams with fresh flowing water. The forest felt “alive” — it supported an entire eco-system mostly unknown to us, waiting to be discovered. We walked along the slopes of the mountains, with no definite or marked pathways. We stepped into a web of twigs sometimes, not knowing what is underneath. It was hard to even leave footprints behind. Every step had to be watched carefully to not step on an insect. The slopes were slippery due to the rain, I slipped and fell often. My feet did not feel confident. And ascending the mountains in this kind of a terrain was a whole new challenge that I was unprepared for. The excitement of accidentally running into a gorilla while we were busy keeping one foot in front of the other and managing to stay upright kept us going. I looked up to see any sign of sunshine, searching for a single ray of light that had managed to escape the dense canopy. There were hardly any. We were inside. Deeper and deeper into the rain forest, where getting lost was the easiest.</p>

<p>The trees were not very thick, but were slender and tall. They grew on the slopes. The trees were densely populated. It created a micro climate that was several degrees cooler. And, rain was a constant, even in the dry season, the rain forests are green and thriving with amazing bird and insect life. There was moss growing everywhere — on rocks, on twigs, on the tree barks. Whatever we touched was soft and moist. The rocks were slippery and difficult to step on. The water flowing in the streams was pristine. The rain forests have their own mechanism of creating and using the water necessary to keep them evergreen. The condensation from the forests will form clouds which will pour again as rain. So the water is cycled within. The vegetation is well suited for primates and apes that inhabit these forests. The entire stretch along the equator was once covered with dense rain forests, which in their true form could be found only in DRC at present and some small pockets of degraded forests like Kakamega in Kenya. Although difficult to spot due to the dense vegetation, there are innumerable species of monkeys and birds living on the higher branches of these trees.</p>

<p>The walk took us about three hours, during which we were exhausted trying to just keep ourselves from falling. The stick helped in supporting with the walk. My shoes were not doing great and I was afraid it would give way and I had to walk barefoot in this terrain, which was unimaginable. A pair of gum boots would be better suited as they would be completely water proof and knee length. We had tucked our pants inside the socks as the forest was notoriously popular for safari ants that would simply crawl up you legs and sting you when you least expect in places that you cannot describe. Due to the cold climate and the altitude, leeches were non existent.</p>

<p>The gorilla group we were trying to follow was giving us a hard time, moving between hills very quickly. The sound of various monkeys and birds pierced the silence now and then. It would have been impossible to find the gorillas on our own without the help of the forest rangers who are well versed with this terrain and could follow signs of their presence — chewed up shoots, pathways where vegetation is flattened due to their movement, fresh dung, new nests they built previous night and following the fruiting trees. The gorillas look for fruiting trees, especially figs and they keep moving in search of better tasting fruits. They mostly eat leaves but in fruiting season, they develop a preference for fruits to supplement their leaf diet. Occasionally they also feed on insects, snails and other creepy crawlies they can find on the forest floor.</p>

<p>We climbed and got down three more hills, crossing smaller streams on the way that led to a clearing. Then, there was right in front of us, a black, huge, hairy animal that was coming rolling towards us. It was a gorilla! It was hard to believe that we could see one at such close range. I got goosebumps to see my close relative. And to know that we share 98% of genetic material with them, which is remarkable. So to run into one and look into it in its eye is like meeting a long lost family member who was discovered suddenly. The feeling when it looked back at me in the eye was unforgettable. There was a deep sense of belonging I felt, which was stronger than what I have felt for any human being I have not known closely.</p>
<p>There were no introductions needed. And, there were no awkward moments. I felt completely comfortable in their company and they took it quite well too. Their size was a bit intimidating, these are huge, powerful animals and it is wise to leave them alone and keep a distance, lest we provoke them. I just stared at him, the rugged palms with nails, the large nostrils, the curved mouth which extended. And, the eyes which were deep, brown and so expressive. The expressions of the face, the gestures, the body postures, everything so similar to humans. The similarity is unmistakable.</p>

<p>I could just sit there and stare at them for hours. They were a small family with a silverback, two females, two toddlers and two juveniles. The silverback, named Kanyonyi, who was about 38 years of age was the head of the family and he made his presence felt. He was large with a huge head, hefty arms and legs. He grunted, farted and just lazed around, constantly watching over his family. The toddlers, just a few months old were playing with their mums or jumping on their dad’s back. It was amusing to watch them climb slender plants and try to take support and get surprised when the poor plant would give way and break due to their weight. And they would try this all over again.</p>
<p>The mum was lying down on her side, crossing her leg, keeping her head slightly lifted and supported by one arm and looking at me from the top of her head, upside down. She stared at me and did not feel threatened or excited. She was calm. The younger ones at some point got naughty and started coming closer to us. We stepped back with every movement. But they just playfully tried to snatch the small stick that the ranger was carrying.</p>

<p>Time passed by so quickly, it was already an hour and I did not realise. I was spellbound by this unique rendezvous. For those minutes I sat there with them, I was completely detached from reality. I did not think of anything. Just sat there and observed them. Nothing else in this world seemed to bother me at that point of time. My mind was cleared of thoughts that had haunted me so far — about the fragility of this delicate eco-system, that there were less than a thousand of them left, that their species is threatened by human activities like poaching, destruction of rainforests and spread of diseases. I was only feeling a sense of belonging. I became one among them, lost in the simplicity of existence.</p>
